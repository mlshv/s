  <i>s stands for save, sync, and simple</i>

## What is s?
This is my personal yet public board for saving links, copypastas, etc.

### Live
[mlshv.me/s](https://mlshv.me/s)

### I made it because
* Sometimes I need quickly save some text (like in Google Keep) without logging in and simply open it later without remembering or writing down the link (like pastebin.com)
* I needed a pet project to practice React / Redux
