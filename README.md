  <i>s stands for save, sync, and simple</i>

## What is s?
This is my personal yet public board for saving links, copypastas, etc.

### I made it because
* Sometimes I need quickly save something without logging in (like Google Keep) and simply get access to it without remembering or writing down the link (like pastebin.com)
* I needed a pet project to practice React
